# NewCongressionalAppGit---Synapse-Match
We  created this repository in order to fully compile all the different workspaces we have used. 

# All the files have been re-uploaded by Rushil, the group worked on each and every file, but delegated him to re-upload. Full constructed app can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17wqE6RFeqJRcI_9V5w_D-dV4eKjVjeoH?usp=drive_link)
